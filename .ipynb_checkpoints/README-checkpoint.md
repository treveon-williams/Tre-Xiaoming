# Project: Machine learning analysis for different sectors

## Group: Treveon Williams, Xiaoming Wang

# Project goals: Our aim is to create an algorithmic trading bot to test the performance of different sectors. We will use machine learning libraries(one in class, one out of class) for the construction of the trading bot. Utilizing technical indicators and use time series analysis to compare and analyze the performance of the algorithm and the stock market sectors given below. 

# Steps: 
# Collect data for different sectors: 1. tech sector ETFs 2. healthcare sector ETFs 3. finance sector ETFs. 
# Clean data and fit data to the models
# Create the technical indicators and connect them to the models 
# Backtest the models
# Run the model for each of the sectors
# Plot the results of each sector
# Use Time Series Analysis for evaluating performance
# Save the png pictures into README.md
# Analyze the results and get the conclusion if our algrithom better predict the performance.
